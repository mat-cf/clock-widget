Simple clock widget built using Python and TKinter

![screenshot](/screenshot-clock.png)

## Why?
I wanted to make my desktop cleaner, so I made the taskbar hidden by using default Windows 11 configuration. But there was no easy way to see the clock, unless I hover on it. So this is my attempt to keep things clean, but useful

## Running on startup

- Open run.bat to start
- Move the shortcut into the startup folder, so it runs alongside other startup applications `C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`).
- To close, just press ESC
